I'm a QA Engineer with over 3 years of experience.  
I'm passionate about technology, testing, and software development.  
I'm committed to ongoing professional development and continuously learning new technologies.  
Recently, I have been engaging in learning and experimentation with iOS development, and I am looking forward to resuming these efforts soon.
